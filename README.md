Projects for cs188

## Search
In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I built general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

## Multi-Agent Search
In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implemented both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.

## Reinforcement Learning
In this project, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning. I tested your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

## Ghostbusters(tracking)
Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman’s great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.

## Machine Learning
A neural network to classify digits, and more!
